Date created: April 16, 2020

## Our question
What are the most popular ethnic cuisines in different states of the
United States and how do they evolve from 2004 to 2020?

## Methodology
We scrape Google trend indices from 2004 to 2020 as a function of
time and states. We use D3.js to create an interactive data visualization
to answer our question.

Our final product is shown here:

This is a work in progress.
