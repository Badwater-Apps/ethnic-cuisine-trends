## Our motivations
Aaron Tang is an avid cook. Skyler Dong might entertain you with
some homemade breads and roasted beef, but is usually too busy to cook.
Ethnic cuisines are a mjor component of diet in the US. There are many
types of ethnic cuisines in the US. Different cuisines are popular in
different regions.

## Our question
What are the most popular ethnic cuisines in different states of the
United States and how do they evolve from 2004 to 2020?

## Methodology
We scrape Google trend indices from 2004 to 2020 as a function of
time and states. We use D3.js to create an interactive data visualization
to answer our question.

## Results and discussion
Our final product is shown here:
